# Create a Function
An individual needs to go grocery shopping and get enough food to make their meals for the week. They want to spend as little money as possible while making sure they consume exactly 2000 calories each day. There are five possible grocery items that they like to choose from: meat, white fish, chicken, salmon, and tofu. 

In the previous lesson, we had the following Python code:  

```
if c == "tofu":  
    print("Tofu is cheap and has good calories")
		
elif c == "meat":  
    print("Meat has the most calories")
		
elif c == "salmon" or c == "white fish":  
    print("Seafood is expensive but is healthy")
		
else:  
    print("Chicken has fewer calories than meat")
```

For this assignment, you will define a function which includes all the if statements provided, then checks the output if your argument is “meat”. 


## Exercise

The Python file that you will work on is named ``function_practice.py``.  Open it, then follow the instructions below:

1.	Create a function and name it ``grocery``.
2.	List the parameter of the ``grocery`` function.
3.	Include all the if statements in your function, as provided in the previous if-statement code.
4.	Call the function by using the string argument ``"meat"``.
